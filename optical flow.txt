opencv Python homography sample


opencv add mask to map an image over anther

global motion 

localised objects motion

light texture movement is similar to object/pixel movement

gradient and motion can be different in illusions 

features tracking is sparse traking. sparse tracking is different from sift. 

same moving object has different flow

-sift
-optical flow

application
-motion based segmentation jb or jo body move ho sirf uska video sequence save ho specifically
-video compression only keep moving object and remove background
